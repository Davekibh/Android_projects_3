# Students-admission-app

So,Basically this is my Third Android project which I have coded in the Android Studio.
So this a Students Info page where you are asked to fill three inputs.
1) Name 
2) Surname
3) Marks
4) Id
So Id is not compulsory when your adding the data.
And it also has three buttons.
1) Add Data
2) View Data
3) Delete Data
You must also Download Database Browser.Because we are dealing in adding,viewing and deleting the record.
The link for download is "https://sqlitebrowser.org/".
so you will see how the database works in android and it was an exciting thing to learn.
Happy Coding :)
